Hello! I'm Litao Qiao, also known online as Joeyonng. I'm currently a PhD student in ECE department of University of California, San Diego (UCSD) since 2020.
UCSD is also where I earned my bachelor's in 2018. 

My primary research interest is [Explainable machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence) and my expertise extends to general machine learning theory, combinatorial logic, and deep learning. 

This website serves as a platform for sharing my learned knowledge and research notes. 
Additionally, I enjoy developing web applications and you can find some of my side projects in my Github.
