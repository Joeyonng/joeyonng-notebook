## Welcome {.unnumbered}

Here is my notebook where I used to share my summaries on general machine learning methods.

The goal is to make my notes **formal**, **comprehensive** and most importantly, **easy-to-read**.

This repository is far from complete and I will continue to cover more topics as I learn more in my PhD journey. 

Feel free to point any error you found in my notes. 
Any suggestions will be much appreciated!.
